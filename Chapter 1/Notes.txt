===========
 - A computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data.
 
 - A computer includes both hardware and software.
        ■ Hardware - Comprises the visible, physical elements of the computer.
        ■ Software - Provides the invisible instructions that control the hardware and make it perform specific tasks.
 
 - A computer consists of the following major hardware components:
        ■ A central processing unit (CPU)
        ■ Memory (main memory)
        ■ Storage devices (such as disks and CDs)
        ■ Input devices (such as the mouse and keyboard)
        ■ Output devices (such as monitors and printers)
        ■ Communication devices (such as modems and network interface cards)

 - A computer’s components are interconnected by a subsystem called a bus. You can think of a bus as a sort of system of roads running among the computer’s components; data and 
   power travel along the bus from one part of the computer to another.
