 What is a Computer?
=====================
 - A computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data.
 
 - A computer includes both hardware and software.
        ■ Hardware - Comprises the visible, physical elements of the computer.
        ■ Software - Provides the invisible instructions that control the hardware and make it perform specific tasks.
 
 - A computer consists of the following major hardware components:
        ■ A central processing unit (CPU)
        ■ Memory (main memory)
        ■ Storage devices (such as disks and CDs)
        ■ Input devices (such as the mouse and keyboard)
        ■ Output devices (such as monitors and printers)
        ■ Communication devices (such as modems and network interface cards)

 - A computer’s components are interconnected by a subsystem called a bus. You can think of a bus as a sort of system of roads running among the computer’s components; data and 
   power travel along the bus from one part of the computer to another.

 - A computer consists of a CPU, memory, storage devices, input devices, output devices, and communication devices.

 - The central processing unit (CPU) is the computer’s brain. It retrieves instructions from memory and executes them. The CPU usually has two components: a control unit and an 
   arithmetic/logic unit.
        ■ The control unit controls and coordinates the actions of the other components.
        ■ The arithmetic/logic unit performs numeric operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and logical operations (comparisons).

 - A byte is composed of eight bits

 - An encoding scheme is a set of rules that govern how a computer translates characters, numbers, and symbols into data the computer can actually work with.

 - A computer’s storage capacity is measured in bytes and multiples of the byte, as follows:
        ■ A kilobyte (KB) is about 1,000 bytes.
        ■ A megabyte (MB) is about 1 million bytes.
        ■ A gigabyte (GB) is about 1 billion bytes.
        ■ A terabyte (TB) is about 1 trillion bytes

 - A computer’s memory consists of an ordered sequence of bytes for storing programs as well as data that the program is working with.

 - There are three main types of storage devices:
        ■ Magnetic disk drives
        ■ Optical disc drives (CD and DVD)
        ■ USB flash drives

 - Drives are devices for operating a medium, such as disks and CDs.

 - THE KEYBOARD
        ■ Function keys are located across the top of the keyboard and are prefaced with the letter F. Their functions depend on the software currently being used.   
        ■ A modifier key is a special key (such as the Shift, Alt, and Ctrl keys) that modifies the normal action of another key when the two are pressed simultaneously.
        ■ The numeric keypad, located on the right side of most keyboards, is a separate set of keys styled like a calculator to use for entering numbers quickly.
        ■ Arrow keys, located between the main keypad and the numeric keypad, are used to move the mouse pointer up, down, left, and right on the screen in many kinds of programs.
        ■ The Insert, Delete, Page Up, and Page Down keys are used in word processing and other programs for inserting text and objects, deleting text and objects, and moving up or down 
          through a document one screen at a time.
 - THE MOUSE
        ■ A mouse is a pointing device. It is used to move a graphical pointer (usually in the shape of an arrow) called a cursor around the screen or to click on-screen objects (such as a button) to 
          trigger them to perform an action.

 - THE MONITOR
        ■ The monitor displays information (text and graphics). The screen resolution and dot pitch determine the quality of the display.
        ■ The screen resolution specifies the number of pixels in horizontal and vertical dimensions of the display device.
        ■ Pixels (short for “picture elements”) are tiny dots that form an image on the screen.
        ■ The dot pitch is the amount of space between pixels, measured in millimeters. The smaller the dot pitch, the sharper the display.

 - COMMUNICATION DEVICES 
        ■ A dial-up modem uses a phone line and can transfer data at a speed up to 56,000 bps (bits per second).
        ■ A digital subscriber line (DSL) connection also uses a standard phone line, but it can transfer data 20 times faster than a standard dial-up modem.
        ■ A cable modem uses the cable TV line maintained by the cable company and is generally faster than DSL.
        ■ A network interface card (NIC) is a device that connects a computer to a local area network (LAN). LANs are commonly used in universities, businesses, and government agencies. A high-speed NIC called 1000BaseT 
          can transfer data at 1,000 million bits per second (mbps).
        ■ Wireless networking is now extremely popular in homes, businesses, and schools. Every laptop computer sold today is equipped with a wireless adapter that enables the computer to connect to a local area network and the Internet.

 Programming Languages
=======================
 - A computer’s native language, which differs among different types of computers, is its
   machine language—a set of built-in primitive instructions.

 - A computer’s native language, which differs among different types of computers, is its
   machine language—a set of built-in primitive instructions.

 - Assembly language uses a short descriptive word, known as a mnemonic, to represent each of the
   machine-language instructions.

 - An assembler translates assembly-language instructions into machine code.

 - Assembly language is referred to as a low-level language, because
   assembly language is close in nature to machine language and is machine dependent.

 - The instructions in a high-level programming language are called
   statements.

       TABLE 1.1 Popular High-Level Programming Languages
       ==================================================
       Language          Description
       ==================================================
       Ada               Named for Ada Lovelace, who worked on mechanical general-purpose computers. The Ada language was
                         developed for the Department of Defense and is used mainly in defense projects.
       
       BASIC             Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. It was designed to be learned and used easily by beginners.
       
       C                 Developed at Bell Laboratories. C combines the power of an assembly language with the ease of use and
                         portability of a high-level language.
       
       C++               C++ is an object-oriented language, based on C.
       
       C#                Pronounced “C Sharp.” It is a hybrid of Java and C++ and was developed by Microsoft.
       
       COBOL             COmmon Business Oriented Language. Used for business applications.
       
       FORTRAN           FORmula TRANslation. Popular for scientific and mathematical applications.
       
       Java              Developed by Sun Microsystems, now part of Oracle. It is widely used for developing platform-independent
                         Internet applications.
       
       Pascal            Named for Blaise Pascal, who pioneered calculating machines in the seventeenth century. It is a simple,
                         structured, general-purpose language primarily for teaching programming.
       
       Python            A simple general-purpose scripting language good for writing short programs.
       
       Visual Basic      Visual Basic was developed by Microsoft and it enables the programmers to rapidly develop graphical user
                         interfaces.

 - A program written in a high-level language is called a source program or source code.
       ■ An interpreter reads one statement from the source code, translates it to the machine code or virtual machine code, and then executes it right away, as shown in Figure 1.4a. Note
         that a statement from the source code may be translated into several machine instructions.
       ■ A compiler translates the entire source code into a machine-code file, and the machine-code file is then executed.

Operation Systems
=================

 - The operating system (OS) is the most important program that runs on a computer.
   The OS manages and controls a computer’s activities.

 - The major tasks of an operating system are as follows:
       ■ Controlling and monitoring system activities
       ■ Allocating and assigning system resources
       ■ Scheduling operations

 - Operating systems perform basic tasks, such as recognizing input from the keyboard, sending output to the monitor, keeping track of files and folders on storage devices, and controlling
   peripheral devices, such as disk drives and printers.

 - The operating system is responsible for determining what computer resources a program needs (such as CPU time, memory space, disks, input and output devices) and for allocating
   and assigning them to run the program.

 - Many of today’s operating systems support techniques such as multiprogramming, multithreading, and multiprocessing to increase system performance.
       ■ Multiprogramming allows multiple programs to run simultaneously by sharing the same CPU. The CPU is much faster than the computer’s other components.
       ■ Multithreading allows a single program to execute multiple tasks at the same time.
       ■ Multiprocessing, or parallel processing, uses two or more processors together to perform subtasks concurrently and then combine solutions of the subtasks to obtain a solution
         for the entire task.

Java, the World Wide Web, and Beyond
====================================

 - Java is a full-featured, general-purpose programming language that can be used to develop robust mission-critical applications.

 - Applets employ a modern graphical interface with buttons, text fields, text areas, radio buttons, and so on, to interact with users on the Web and
   process their requests.

 - HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a simple scripting language for laying out documents, linking documents on the Internet, and bringing images, sound, and video alive on the Web.

 - A rich Internet application (RIA) is a Web application designed to deliver the same features and functions normally associated with deskop applications.

The Java Language Specification, API, JDK, and IDE 
==================================================

 - Java syntax is defined in the Java language specification, and the Java library is defined in the Java API.

 - The JDK is the software for developing and running Java programs.

 - An IDE is an integrated development environment for rapidly developing programs.

 - The Java language specification is a technical definition of the Java programming language’s syntax and semantics.

 - The application program interface (API), also known as library, contains predefined classes and interfaces for developing Java programs.

 - Java is a full-fledged and powerful language that can be used in many ways. It comes in
three editions:
    ■ Java Standard Edition (Java SE) to develop client-side applications. The applications
      can run standalone or as applets running from a Web browser.
    ■ Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) to develop server-side applications, such as Java
      servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and JavaServer Faces (JSF).
    ■ Java Micro Edition (Java ME) to develop applications for mobile devices, such as
      cell phones.

 - Java SE is the foundation upon which all other Java technology is based. There are many versions of Java SE. The latest,
   Java SE 8.

A Simple Java Program
======================
( Reference Welcome.java Program file in the package )
======================

 - Line 1 defines a class. Every Java program must have at least one class. Each class has a
   name. By convention, class names start with an uppercase letter. In this example, the class
   name is Welcome.

 - Line 2 defines the main method. The program is executed from the main method. A class
   may contain several methods. The main method is the entry point where the program begins
   execution.

 - A method is a construct that contains statements. The main method in this program contains
   the System.out.println statement.

 - String is a programming term meaning a sequence of characters. A string must be enclosed in double quotation marks.

 - Every statement in Java ends with a semicolon (;), known as the statement terminator.

 - Reserved words, or keywords, have a specific meaning to the compiler and cannot be used
   for other purposes in the program.

 - Lines ( 1 - 5 ) is a comment that documents what the program is and how it is constructed. Comments
   help programmers to communicate and understand the program.

 - In Java, comments are preceded by two slashes (//) on a line, called a line comment, or enclosed between /* and */ on one or several
   lines, called a block comment or paragraph comment. When the compiler sees //, it ignores all text after // on the same line. When it sees /*, it scans for the next */ and ignores any text
   between /* and */.

 - A pair of curly braces in a program forms a block that groups the program’s components.

TABLE 1.2 Special Characters
=========================================================================================================
Character               Name                                                Description
=========================================================================================================
{}             Opening and closing braces                 Denote a block to enclose statements.

()             Opening and closing parentheses            Used with methods.

[]             Opening and closing brackets               Denote an array.

//             Double slashes                             Precede a comment line.

" "            Opening and closing quotation marks        Enclose a string (i.e., sequence of characters).

;              Semicolon                                  Mark the end of a statement.
==========================================================================================================


Creating, Compiling, and Executing a Java Program
=================================================

   - You save a Java program in a .java file and compile it into a .class file. The .class file
     is executed by the Java Virtual Machine.
   
   - The bytecode is similar to machine instructions but is architecture neutral and can
     run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

   - (a) Java source code is translated into bytecode. 
     (b) Java bytecode can be executed on any computer with a Java Virtual Machine.

   - If you execute a class file that does not exist, a NoClassDefFoundError will occur.

   - If you execute a class file that does not have a main method or you mistype the main
     method (e.g., by typing Main instead of main), a NoSuchMethodError will occur.
