1.1 What are hardware and software?

    A: ■ Hardware - Comprises the visible, physical elements of the computer.
       ■ Software - Provides the invisible instructions that control the hardware and make it perform specific tasks.

1.2 List five major hardware components of a computer.

    A: ■ A central processing unit (CPU)
       ■ Memory (main memory)
       ■ Storage devices (such as disks and CDs)
       ■ Input devices (such as the mouse and keyboard)
       ■ Output devices (such as monitors and printers)
       ■ Communication devices (such as modems and network interface cards)

1.3 What does the acronym “CPU” stand for?

    A: ■ Central Processing Unit

1.4 What unit is used to measure CPU speed?

    A: ■ Bytes

1.5 What is a bit? What is a byte?

    A: ■ If the switch is on, its value is 1. If the switch is off, its value is 0. These 0s and 1s are interpreted as digits in the binary system and   are called bits (binary digits).
       
       ■ A byte is composed of eight bits

1.6 What is memory for? What does RAM stand for? Why is memory called RAM?

    A: ■ Memory stores data and program instructions in uniquely addressed memory locations.
       
       ■ Random-Access Memory (RAM)
       
       ■ Because it can be accessed faster than regular memory

1.7 What unit is used to measure memory size?

    A: Hz

1.8 What unit is used to measure disk size?

    A: Bytes

1.9 What is the primary difference between memory and a storage device?

    A: Memory is information that needs to be accessed quickly while storage is information that doesnt need to be accessed on a daily basis only at the need of the user.

===============================================================================

1.10 What language does the CPU understand?

    A: Its machine language—a set of built-in primitive instructions.

1.11 What is an assembly language?

    A: Assembly language uses a short descriptive word, known as a nemonic, to represent each of the
       machine-language instructions.

1.12 What is an assembler?

    A:  An assembler translates assembly-language instructions into machine code.


1.13 What is a high-level programming language?

    A: High-level languages are English-like and easy to  learn and use.

1.14 What is a source program?

    A: A program written in a high-level language.

1.15 What is an interpreter?

    A: An interpreter reads one statement from the source code, translates it to the machine code
       or virtual machine code, and then executes it right away

1.16 What is a compiler?

    A: A compiler translates the entire source code into a machine-code file, and the machine-code file is then executed.

1.17 What is the difference between an interpreted language and a compiled language?

    A: (a) An interpreter translates and executes a program one statement at a time. 
       (b) A compiler translates the entire source program into a machine-language file for execution.

1.18 What is an operating system? List some popular operating systems.

    A: ■ The operating system (OS) is the most important program that runs on a computer.
         The OS manages and controls a computer’s activities.

       ■ Windows, Mac, Linux/UNIX

1.19 What are the major responsibilities of an operating system?

    A: ■ Controlling and monitoring system activities
       ■ Allocating and assigning system resources
       ■ Scheduling operations

1.20 What are multiprogramming, multithreading, and multiprocessing?

    A: ■ Multiprogramming allows multiple programs to run simultaneously by sharing the same CPU. The CPU is much faster than the computer’s 
         other components.
       ■ Multithreading allows a single program to execute multiple tasks at the same time.
       ■ Multiprocessing, or parallel processing, uses two or more processors together to perform subtasks concurrently and then combine solutions of 
         the subtasks to obtain a solution for the entire task.

1.24 What is the Java language specification?

    A: a technical definition of the Java programming language’s syntax and semantics.

1.25 What does JDK stand for?

    A: Java Development Toolkit

1.26 What does IDE stand for?

    A: Integrated Development Environment

1.27 Are tools like NetBeans and Eclipse different languages from Java, or are they dialects or extensions of Java?

    A: Extentions of Java

1.28 What is a keyword? List some Java keywords.

    A: have a specific meaning to the compiler and cannot be used
       for other purposes in the program.
            ■ Public
            ■ Static
            ■ Void

1.29 Is Java case sensitive? What is the case for Java keywords?

    A: Yes
        ■ main // Correct
        ■ Main // incorrect

1.30 What is a comment? Is the comment ignored by the compiler? How do you denote a 
     comment  line and a comment paragraph?

    A: ■ Comments help programmers to communicate and understand the program.
       ■ Yes they are ignored by the compiler
       ■ /* */

1.31 What is the statement to display a string on the console?

    A: System.out.prinln();

1.32 Show the output of the following code:

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("3.5 * 4 / 2 – 2.5 is ");
        System.out.println(3.5 * 4 / 2 – 2.5);
    }
}

    A: 
        STATEMENT 1
       ■ 3.5 * 4 / 2 – 2.5 is 

        STATEMENT 2
       ■ -7
